## Project: Predicting the quality of a Wine

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the `wine_quality.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use  the `winequality-red.csv` dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. If you are interested in how the visualizations are created in the notebook, please feel free to explore this Python file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory  (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook wine_quality.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook winw_quality.ipynb
```
or open with Juoyter Lab
```bash
jupyter lab
```
### Install the required Python packages using pip.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
